# AI Interview Assistant 🤖

An AI-powered interview platform built with Next.js that simulates a real-world, timed technical interview. This application allows candidates to upload a resume for automated information extraction and then engage in a structured interview with a generative AI. Interviewers are provided with a comprehensive dashboard to review all candidate submissions, scores, and AI-generated performance summaries.

## ✨ Features

This project fully implements the requirements of the assignment, including:

- **📄 Automatic Resume Parsing:** Supports both **PDF** and **DOCX** formats to automatically extract candidate name, email, and phone number.
- **🗣️ Missing Information Flow:** If the resume parsing fails to find required details, a secondary form prompts the user to fill them in manually.
- **🧠 Dynamic AI Interview:** A structured 6-question interview (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard) with questions dynamically generated by the Google Gemini AI for a full-stack role.
- **⏱️ Timed Questions:** Each question is timed based on its difficulty (Easy: 20s, Medium: 60s, Hard: 120s), with answers being auto-submitted when time expires.
- **📊 Interviewer Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for interviewers to view a list of all candidates, their final scores, and AI-generated summaries.
- **🔍 Search & Sort:** The dashboard includes functionality to search for candidates and sort them by name or score.
- **💾 Session Persistence:** The entire interview state is persisted in `localStorage`. If a user closes or refreshes the tab, they can resume exactly where they left off.
- **👋 "Welcome Back" Modal:** A friendly modal greets returning users with an in-progress interview, giving them the option to resume or start over.
- **🔔 Toast Notifications:** Clean, non-intrusive notifications for key events like successful resume parsing or interview completion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash

    cd my-ai-interviewer
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Gemini API key:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🏛️ Architectural Decisions

Several key architectural choices were made to meet the project's requirements efficiently and robustly:

- **Next.js App Router & Server Actions:** This was chosen to create a tightly integrated full-stack application. Server Actions provide a seamless and secure way to communicate with the AI API on the server without exposing API keys or requiring the setup of separate API routes.

- **Zustand for State Management:** For an application of this scale, Zustand was selected over Redux for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate. Its powerful `persist` middleware made implementing the session restoration feature trivial.

- **shadcn/ui for Components:** This component library was chosen because it provides unstyled, accessible building blocks that are copied directly into the project. This gives full control over the final look and feel without fighting pre-existing styles, while still benefiting from well-architected component APIs.
